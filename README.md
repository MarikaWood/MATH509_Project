# MATH509_Project
MRI-based Alzheimerâ€™s Classification using CNN

# Alzheimer's Detection from MRI
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI slices into different stages of dementia which is related to the progression of Alzheimer's disease:
- Non-Demented
- Very Mild Dementia
- Mild Dementia

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains MRI slices from patients categorized into dementia stages.

## Model
